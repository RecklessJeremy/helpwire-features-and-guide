[HelpWire](https://www.helpwire.app/) is a free remote access solution for Windows, macOS, and Linux, with support for cross-platform connections. Its features are best suited for remote support, with a single operator being able to keep track of and communicate with numerous clients.

**HelpWire’s notable features include:**

- Multi-monitor support
- Unattended access
- Team management
- Built-in text chat
- Easy file transfers

Most importantly, sessions are easy to start, and clients don’t need to install anything - only to follow a link.

HelpWire sessions can be started in 2 ways - by using HelpWire Quick Connect, or by creating an account and setting your computer up as a HelpWire operator. The former method is quicker, but it lacks some features, mainly the ones related to client info and management.

## How to start a quick HelpWire session

1. Go to the [Quick Connect download page](https://www.helpwire.app/download/).
